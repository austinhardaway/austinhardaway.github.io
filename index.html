                    <p><em>University of Georgia - August 2017 - Present</em> - I work wtih a team of undergraduate and graduate TA's to help
                    teach a rigorous Inroduction to Programming for Computer Science majors. The class is based in Java
                    and covers everything from basic data types to Object Oriented Programming. This position has caused me to
                    get better at relaying technical information effectively and quickly in laymens terms as well as working with
                    a team in a professional setting. I am responsible for helping students complete coding assignments and grading assignments
                    as well as fielding questions from students about Java, Programming, and Computer Science in general.</p>

                    <p><em>WoodmenLife - May 2016 - July 2016</em> - I worked on a small team of developers on an internal website that hosted
                    preformance metrics, information on past and pending buisness, and news from within the company. I participated in daily
                    stand-up scrums and was able to work on every part of our stack. I was responsible for completing 20 hours of estimated
                    development tickets in a sprint that ranged from simple bug-fixes to implementing a completely new feature. <br><br>The MyWoodmen
                    website runs on Java/Spring/SQL and I learned to use tools like Gradle, Jenkins, JIRA, JPA, and Hibernate. This position
                    made me want to have a carrer in web development and made me learn to operate in a fast paced profesional setting with a team
                    of developers by utilizing the Agile methodology. </p>

                  <p>This is an on and off project written in Node.js using GitHub's <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron Framework.</a>
                  It is mostly a proof of concept and a learning experiecne using frontend web development to create a desktop application.
                  Right now functionality is limited, but I have the basic functionality including generating a new password, saving that password
                  and allowing the user to have one password to get all of their other passwords.<br>I hope to extend this functionality and include
                  implementation for storing passwords online with basic CRUD procedures and encryption, but this project takes a back burner
                  to school work for now!</p>

              court room scenarios. I have been a competing member of the UGA Mock Trial team for three years. This is an excellent activity to
              hone public speaking skills and learn to relate large amounts of sometimes technical information to others. We compete for a panel
              of judges who don't know what the case is even about in the beginning and our job is to give a persuasive argument for our side of
              the case using facts from a lengthy case document all while under a time constraint and being subject to the rules of court room
              procedure.</p>
